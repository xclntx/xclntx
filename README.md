# Hi, I'm Jan 👋  

I'm a **System Integrator & Admin** working with Kubernetes, Rancher, and all the infrastructure that keeps clusters alive.  
I like automating things, keeping systems stable, and exploring DevOps tools.  

But that's just one side of me:  
- 👽 Alien logic, human interface – my way of seeing and solving problems  
- 💻 Oldschool internet kid (IRC days, handle: **xclnt/xclntx**)  
- 🎮 Gamer since 1982 (Xbox & retro classics are my world)  

## 🔧 Tech focus
- Kubernetes / Rancher / Fleet  
- Infrastructure & automation  
- CI/CD with GitHub & Harbor  
- Cloud: Google & self-hosted clusters  

## 📌 Pinned Projects
Here you’ll find a mix of work & play:
- Infrastructure & DevOps snippets  
- Cluster setups & automation examples  
- Hobby repos: gaming notes & retro-internet fun
