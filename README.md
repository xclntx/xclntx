# Hi, I'm Jan ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a **System Integrator & Admin** working with Kubernetes, Rancher, and all the infrastructure that keeps clusters alive.  
I like automating things, keeping systems stable, and exploring DevOps tools.  

But that's just one side of me:  
- ðŸ‘½ Alien logic, human interface â€“ my way of seeing and solving problems  
- ðŸ’» Oldschool internet kid (IRC days, handle: **xclnt/xclntx**)  
- ðŸŽ® Gamer since 1982 (Xbox & retro classics are my world)  

## ðŸ”§ Tech focus
- Kubernetes / Rancher / Fleet  
- Infrastructure & automation  
- CI/CD with GitHub & Harbor  
- Cloud: Google & self-hosted clusters  

## ðŸ“Œ Pinned Projects
Here youâ€™ll find a mix of work & play:
- Infrastructure & DevOps snippets  
- Cluster setups & automation examples  
- Hobby repos: gaming notes & retro-internet fun
